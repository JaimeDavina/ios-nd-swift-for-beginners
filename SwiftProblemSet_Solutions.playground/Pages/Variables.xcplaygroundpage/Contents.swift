//: ## Variables
//: In these exercises, you will create variables and constants, and you will handle simple compiler areas that arise when working with them.
/*:
 ### Exercise 1
 
 For each of the following names and types, create a variable or constant that best represents it:
 
 - gallonsRemainingInTank (Double)
 - ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (Int)
 - studentNickname (String)
 - teaspoonsNutmeg (Float)
 */
// Solution
var gallonsRemainingInTank: Double = 6.5
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks: Int = 7
var studentNickName: String = "Danimal"
var teaspoonsNutmeg: Float = 1.5

//: ### Exercise 2
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants:
//Solution
var favoriteLanguage: String = "Swift"
gallonsRemainingInTank = 2.0
ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32
let teaspoonsCinnamon = teaspoonsNutmeg

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Below is some code to reverse a string. We've declared the entities stringToReverse and arrayOfCharacters as variables. Rewrite this code to reverse a string using only constants declared with let, no variables. Note: In the new version you may use as many constants as you'd like.

// Solution
let stringToReverse = "Mutable or Immutable? That is the question."
let arrayOfCharacters = stringToReverse.characters.reversed()
let reversedString = String(arrayOfCharacters)

/*:
 ### Exercise 4
 
 For the following descriptions, create a variable or constant that best represents it:
 
 - an Int value representing the hunger level of an animal over time.
 - an Int value representing the score always required to win a game.
 - a String value representing a studentâ€™s birthday.
 - a String value representing what a user types into the status update area.
 */
// Solution
var hungerLevel: Int = 5
let scoreRequiredToWin: Int = 100
let birthday = "July 28th"
var status = "Chillaxin'"

//: [Next](@next)
